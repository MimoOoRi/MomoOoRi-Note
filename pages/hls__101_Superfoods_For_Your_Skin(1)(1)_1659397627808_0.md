Shoppers and beauty brands seem to think so.

- In a March 2021 trend prediction report, Whole Foods Market Inc. dubbed the category “juiced-up” skin care. And a new group of entrepreneurs is running into the space with ==straightforward== ideas. Byroe founder Amy Roe was inspired to launch her food-focused beauty line after noticing her Columbia Business School peers grabbing salads for lunch.
	- straightforward adj. 简单易懂的；坦率地
	- be spired to 受到启发
- “They were quick, easy, and nutritious,” she says. And I thought to myself, ‘Why can’t we apply that same level of nutrition to our skin care routines?’ ” Her Salmon cream ($125) aims to brighten, soften, and firm skin using the omega-3 fatty acids and proteins found in salmon caviar extract, egg yolk, and ==niacinamide==. The line also ==features== a Tofu gel cream ($85), Tomato serum ($150), and Bell Pepper serum ($110). It’s a salad indeed.

- There’s a big difference between eating a superfood and ==smearing== it on your face, however. “Mixing these superfoods in a blender [to eat] and putting them into skin care is not the same, as the skin cannot readily extract the key active ingredients from these foods,” says ==board-certified== ==dermatologist== Anthony Rossi, who’s bringing out a clean, clinical skin-care line, Dr. Rossi Derm MD, in March. Formulation is key to help deliver star ingredients. “Certain plant botanicals and peptides can be extracted or synthesized from these and made soluble for skin preparations,” he says.
	- board-certified  资格认证
	- clinical 临床上的
	- bring out = produce
	- skin-care  护肤产品

- Orvos Skin Science founder Rob Schwarcz, an oculofacial plastic surgeon, believes there’s potential in these nutritional treatments, but only under certain conditions. “If these products have truly high-intensity extracts of the plant-based products in a really high-end forum, they can be incredible for your skin,” he says.
- To avoid ==falling for== a trendy ==catchphrase==, Schwarcz advises consumers to read labels. Ingredients are listed from highest to lowest concentration; if avocado is the hero ingredient, but listed at the bottom, ==its benefits will be minimal at best==.
	- fall for  迷恋；信以为真
		- She fall for the excuse I gave her.
	- catchphrase 标语，口号
- Schwarcz notes that all this superfood marketing jargon has jump-started research. For example, Molecules, a peer-reviewed chemistry journal, in 2018 published an Italian study that found artichoke extract contained polyphenols that may act as an anti-==inflammatory==, protecting against oxidative damage.
	- jargon  n. 行话，术语
		- business jargon  /  technology jargon
	- jump-start   v.  启动，发动
	- inflammatory  adj.  炎症的
- “Skin-care brands jump on the superfood trends because the marketing is done for them through the food industry,” says New York dermatologist Shereene Idriss. “People ==latch on== because they’re ==chic==, they’re of the day, people know about them.”
	- jump on the ... trend  紧跟趋势
	- latch on  理解
	- chic  adj. 时髦的，流行的
	- of the day  当天的，当代的，当时的
- But Idriss, the creator of the # Pillowtalkderm series on Instagram, is waiting for more data to be released. “I think there is going to be ==merit== to a lot of these superfoods having certain benefits to your skin that are going to be exposed ==down the road==, through studies,” she says. But “the merit ==has yet to== be proven.”
	- merit  n.  优点
